# Lab 4 Report - Open Source Licensing

## Step 1 - Give a Creative Commons license to your lab report
See bottom of document.

## Step 2 - Read the [four criteria for Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
1. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (Access to the source code is a precondition for this).
2. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Step 3 - Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?

It's important to choose a license because it legally permits someone to own or use something, do a particular thing, or carry on a trade. Adding on, a license protects the owner's intellectual property. A license also defines the responsibilities of whoever uses the software, or enters said license agreement, and may impose restrictions on how the software can be used.

## Step 4 - Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

One shouldn't use a project without an explicit license because it could lead to legal repurcussions. Specifically, using software without a proper license constitutes copyright infrigement and could incur costly fees. For example, in April 2011, [two Indiana businesses agreed to pay fines totaling almost half a million dollars](https://www.allbusiness.com/software-licensing-what-you-dont-know-can-hurt-you-15636003-1.html) for using unlicensed versions of Microsoft, Symanteec, Corel, and Autodesk software.

## Step 5 - Do you agree with the claim made in [Failure to follow the open systems model](https://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) section of _Why The Web Beat Gopher_?

When developing software with an open systems model, I agree with the claim that both open communications standards and open source software is necessary. Adding on, I agree that the two work best when implemented together. Though certain projects may need direction from some centralized body, in the case of open source software, a decentralized process is desirable. This is largely driven by the idea that ["users of a successful computer technology always outnumber the people who created it."](https://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) So, in order for software with an open systems model to flourish, developers are better off releasing their software to the public early to let the overall community make the code improvements and modificiations.

## Step 6 - Why does Microsoft's .NET Runtime use the MIT License?

The [.NET Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) uses the MIT license. Microsoft created .NET with open-source in mind, running on the idea of having no licensing costs. This history of .NET being open source is further explained by Microsoft's Visual Studio Code--a free cross-platform code editor. Microsoft's open source philosophy for .NET is emphasized by the fact that it is under the .NET Foundation, which is an independent organization meant to foster open development and collarboration around the entire .NET ecosystem. As such, it's clear why the .NET runtime is licensed under the MIT license: a license that essentially allows devcelopers to do whatever they want as long as they include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software.
