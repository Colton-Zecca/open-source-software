### Test Image 2
An interesting thing to note is that the Ankle boot prediction does not work when the boot's toes face right in the picture, which is why you see the boot mirrored in the improved model. This is because the data set that we train the model off of only has boots facing one way. After making this change along with improving the image processing, the model is extremely confident in its prediction of what Image 2 is--an Ankle boot!

## Notes on Predictions
Due to issues with noise in the images, I was unable to get it to recognize the correct image despite doing all of the proper image handling (Update: Before midnight, updated with improved image processing later). In the essence of time, I'm going to submit what I have now to show that I have working code and make some commits after to try and get rid of some of the noise in my images. If I get the image formatting to properly work with my custom images, I'll add them to this lab and make note that it was added after the midnight deadline for personal sake.
