## Bio
Hello! My name is Colton Zecca and I am a junior majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology and Web Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My drive stems from results produced and the satisfaction that goes hand in hand with them. I have a diverse amount of work experience in multiple programming languages and I'm looking to continue my development as a computer scientist through work-based experience. Working on a project that will make any difference—no matter how small—leads me to not only learn the most, but produce results that exceed expectations.
